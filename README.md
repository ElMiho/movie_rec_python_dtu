# Movie recommendation projekt at DTU (course: 02525)

## Description
In this project the *Pearson Correlation* is used alongside a weighted-average-corrected method for predicting what movie a user would like based on similar users. 
It also predicts using an average and an average corrected for comparison. 

## Usage
Run the command:
`python3 movie_rec.py`

This will calculate everything based on 4 users who have rated 6 movies - ratings from 1-5 with 5 being the best. 
The variable `movie_data` can be modified for different data.
